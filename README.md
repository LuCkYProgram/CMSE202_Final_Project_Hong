# CMSE202_Final_Project


## Predicting the Sentiment of Movie Reviews

Group G: Carson Honkala, Hannah Striebel, Foster Krause, Kevin Hong, Ben Sinko

CMSE 202 section 004

Spring 2021


### How to run the code

The code for our project can be found in the `CMSE202_GroupG_Final.ipynb` jupyter notebook in this repository. To run the models, simply sequentially run the cells in the notebook.

In order to tune our hyperparameters for some of the models, `GridSearchCV` was implemented; however, it took many hours to run. This code is included in the notebook in markdown cells.


### Group Member Contributions

Each group member contributed to the final presentation. In addition, each group member chose a Machine Learning model on which to train the dataset, evaluate its performance, and write up how it works.
